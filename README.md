# Draw Geometry CPP

A simple C++ program utilizing the graphics.h library to draw geometric shapes in the Cartesian coordinate system (Oxy). The program includes functionality to draw points, triangles, polygons, and perform translations, offering a fundamental demonstration of graphic representation and transformation in C++.

## Features

- Cartesian Plane Drawing: Utilizes the graphics.h library to draw a clear representation of the Cartesian plane.
- Labeled Axes: X and Y axes are labeled for easy identification and orientation.
- Arrowheads: Includes arrowheads at the ends of each axis for visual clarity.
- Point Drawing: Plot points on the Cartesian plane.
- Triangle Visualization: Construct and display triangles with ease.
- Polygon Rendering: Implement the drawing of polygons with a flexible number of vertices.
- Translation: Perform translations of shapes in the Cartesian plane by specifying the translation vector.

## Usage

1. Include the graphics.h Library: Ensure the graphics.h library is properly included and configured in your C++ development environment.
2. Compile and Run: Compile the C++ program and execute it to visualize the drawing of the Cartesian plane and perform translations.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and explore the source code to understand the implementation details. Adjust parameters, such as window size or axis labeling, to suit your preferences.

**Note:** Please be aware that some comments and variable names may still be in Vietnamese. You may use AI translation tools to automatically translate them into your preferred language.

## Dependencies

- graphics.h: Ensure the availability and proper configuration of the graphics library in your C++ environment.
